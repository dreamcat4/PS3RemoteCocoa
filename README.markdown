### PS3Remote Cocoa

This is an example to show communication between Sony PS3 BD Remote and Cocoa.

The application window does nothing. This project is mainly for debugging purposes - to set breakpoints in the XCode gdb debugger. There are various callbacks listening for Bluetooth messages from the Sony Remote.

### Credit

Most of this code was lifted directly from the Spiral OSS Media Player, by Axel Andersson. Many thanks. There also remain stubs for the Apple IR Remote and the WiiMote. Code for those can also been found in Spiral Project trac / svn repository.
